Tips Dataset Kernel Density Estimation

This project aims to perform a kernel density estimation on the "Tips" dataset to understand the distribution of tips received by waiters in a restaurant. The dataset includes information such as the total bill amount, tip amount, day of the week, time of day, and size of the party.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

tips_dataset_kernel_density_estimation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the project.
tips.csv: Data file for the analysis.
Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages listed in the Requirements section.

Results

The project presents a comprehensive kernel density estimation of the "Tips" dataset, with an emphasis on understanding the distribution of tips received by waiters. The analysis includes visual representations of the distribution using kernel density plots and histograms, as well as an examination of the relationship between the total bill amount, tip amount, day of the week, time of day, and size of the party. The results provide valuable insights into the tipping behavior of customers in the restaurant.
